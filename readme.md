# Predicting durability of resistance to crop pathogens: when is incorporating stochasticity necessary?

## Undergraduate project/dissertation

Genetically engineering disease-resistance in crops is an effective way to reduce yield loss due to pathogens. Therefore, ensuring maximum disease-resistance durability in the face of pathogen evolution is an increasingly pressing issue in modern agriculture. The majority of mathematical models in this study area are deterministic rather than stochastic, despite many of them involving scenarios where  pathogen extinction is likely, such as emergence of a resistance-breaking trait. The aim of this study,
therefore, was to compare how different genetic and epidemiological processes affect resistance durability in a stochastic versus a deterministic model. The results of the two models I created were
compared to identify scenarios where the addition of stochasticity gives a substantially different result for the epidemic intensity. This will help inform future studies about the importance of stochasticity in certain contexts, and highlights the importance of an understanding of the dynamics of a biological system in order to ensure modelling most closely represents reality.

### Methodology

I analysed the difference in epidemic intensity between the stochastic and deterministic models in relation to three characteristics. Two were characteristics of the R gene - its robustness and the fitness cost of the resistance-breaking pathogen. The other was an ecological characteristic - the degree of connectivity of the landscape. See Section 2.1 for an in-depth model description.

### Key results:

In general, stochasticity is required when there's a high risk of extinction of the resistance-breaking (rb)
(and in some cases the wild-type) pathogen. One important case of this is when there's a low emergence frequency of the rb pathogen, caused by a robust resistance (R) gene in the crop.

**Robustness of R gene**

The robustness of the resistance (R) gene appears to be the most significant factor of the ones analysed, as when compared with both the fitness cost of the resistance-breaking (rb) trait and the degree of landscape connectivity, it had far more effect than either of them on the extent of the difference in resistance durability between the stochastic and deterministic models.

The robustness of the R gene was represented by the initial levels of the resistance-breaking (rb) pathogen strain, which has a large impact on whether extinction of the pathogen is likely. At high levels of robustness (low initial levels of rb strain) extinction is highly likely, and as this is only represented in the stochastic model, this caused a large disparity between the stochastic and deterministic epidemic intensities.

**Landscape connectivity**

As my models include crops that are both Susceptible (S) and Resistant (R) to the pathogen, the degree of landscape connectivity is the extent to which the two crop types are mixed. On its own, changing landscape connectivity didn't appear to have much effect on the difference in resistance durability
between the deterministic and stochastic models. However, the addition of stochasticity did reveal dynamics that the deterministic model could not in the case of the relationship between landscape connectivity and the fitness cost of the rb pathogen. See Section 4.1 under 'Landscape connectivity' for further details.
